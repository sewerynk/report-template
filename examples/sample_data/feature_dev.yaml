project_name: "My Project"
author: "John Doe"
feature_name: "User Authentication"
repository: "https://github.com/org/repo"
branch: "feature/auth"
sprint: "Sprint 5"
summary: "Implementation of user authentication system with OAuth2 support."

    role: "Lead Developer"
    email: "john@example.com"
  - name: "Jane Smith"
    role: "Backend Developer"
    email: "jane@example.com"

objectives:
  - "Implement secure user authentication"
  - "Support OAuth2 providers (Google, GitHub)"
  - "Add session management"

requirements:
  - "Password must be at least 12 characters"
  - "Support multi-factor authentication"
  - "Implement rate limiting"

technical_approach: |
  Using FastAPI for backend, JWT for tokens, and Redis for session storage.

  Key components:
  - OAuth2 client library (Authlib)
  - Redis for session management
  - PostgreSQL for user data

architecture_notes: |
  Microservices architecture with separate auth service and user service.
  API Gateway handles routing and token validation.
